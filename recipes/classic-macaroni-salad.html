                <h2>Can You Make Macaroni Salad Ahead of Time?</h2>
                <p>Yes, macaroni salad makes a great make-ahead potluck dish. In fact, since the flavors need time to meld in the refrigerator, it might actually be better to make it a day or two in advance.</p>

                <h2>How Long Does Macaroni Salad Last?</h2>

                <p><q>This recipe is fantastic, I tasted it when I finished mixing,</q> says Sue Newman. <q>WOW, can't wait for it to get cold. I did make a couple of changesL I used celery salt instead of just salt and left the green pepper and pimento out.</q></p>
                <p><q>Great flavor,</q> raves one community member. <q>I used cellentani pasta and only ⅓ cup sugar. Also used some garlic powder and did not use bell pepper or pimento. Perfect accompaniment to our BBQ.</q></p>
                <p><q>This is a fantastic pasta salad,</q> according to Rebecca Timbers. <q>The only drawback is I have found is that now I am required to bring a big bowl to every family gathering no matter the season or holiday!</q></p>
