                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this recipe:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Oil</strong>: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Pork</strong>: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Sauces</strong>: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Apple cider vinegar</strong>: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Broth</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Onion</strong>: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Buns</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches.</p></li>
